# Minds Matter Summer Programs
An open source project that is attempting to help the Denver Minds Matter (http://mindsmatter.org/) Students organize and search for college summer programs. 

Please feel free to contribute.  It is not a complicated idea/app, but it will help a lot of underprivileged kids achieve their goal of attending college.

If you choose to help out, here are our priotities:

  A user needs to be able to securely sign in.
  There need to be three separate roles for users ('admin', 'mentor', and 'student')
  A student should be associated with a 'cohort'
  A student is associated with a mentor (A student has two mentors, and mentors can only have one student)
  A only three cohorts are active as either 'sophomore', 'junior', 'senior'
  'admin' and 'mentor' should be able to create a summer program post
  A summer program should be associated to a specific cohort (a program can have many cohorts)
  Everyone should be able to see an index of available summer programs
  'admin', 'mentor', and the current student should be able to associate a summer program with a student
  'admin', 'mentor', and the current student should be able to track the progress of a summer program application
  'admin' should have an index view of all current students
  The student index view should show the count, applied, and accepted of associated summer programs for each student
